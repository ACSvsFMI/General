Git flow:
One user creates the repo, other team members has to clone it on his computer.
$ git clone <link of repo>

When you want to track something, is like picking up what objects to photograph:
$ git add . - adds the entire directory in a waterfall manner
/ $ git add <file_name> - add a certain file

$ git commit -m "message" - after you add your changes, commit them, is like taking a picture of your objects above. You can rollback to a certain commit.

$ git push - push your app on Github
$ git pull - download the last version of the app from Github
